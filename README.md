# Sentiment Analysis with TensorFlow and MLflow

## Project Overview
This project develops a sentiment analysis model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify movie reviews into positive or negative sentiments. It integrates MLflow for tracking experiments, tuning hyperparameters, and managing the model lifecycle, including deployment and monitoring.

## Features
- **Data Processing**: Utilizes NLTK to preprocess and vectorize textual data.
- **Model Building**: Leverages TensorFlow and Keras to build and compile a sentiment analysis model.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Uses Keras Tuner for optimizing model parameters.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Employs MLflow for tracking model versions, parameters, and metrics.
- **Model Deployment**: Demonstrates how to deploy the model as a REST API using MLflow's serving capabilities.
- **Model Management**: Utilizes MLflow Model Registry for managing model versions and stages.
